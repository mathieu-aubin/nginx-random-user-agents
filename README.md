# nginx-random-user-agents

### About
This will create (enventually) nginx configuration which will output a random user-agent on each page refresh

### As it stands
Currently, the script properly generates text and html indexes out of a bank of 8527 user-agents.

### Plan

Generate both:

- several types of user-agent indexes
- nginx configuration using (or not?) templates
